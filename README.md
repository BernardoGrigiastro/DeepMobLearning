##### Feedback suggestions

First impressions of the mod.

Is the entry level requirements for the data models too steep? (specifically skeleton/zombie/creeper /w the heads)

Is the entry level requirements for the deep learner or the simulation chamber too steep?  (The simulation chamber is gated behind comparators, e.g the nether)

The pristine chance values will be configurable, but do you have any thoughts on the default values? ( 3%/8%/14%/33% )

Is there any living matter recipes that should be added? (transmutational recipes, like dirt + leaves + living matter = grass)

How do you feel about the pristine matter balancing?

Do you feel like any items are missing from the pristine loot tables?

Do you feel like anything in the mod is not self explanatory or is tough to understand?

What are your thoughts on the polymer clay as far as required crafting goes?

You need 98 defeated monsters to reach the max tier in any given data model, does this number feel too high or too low?
